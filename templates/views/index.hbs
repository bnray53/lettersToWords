                        <h4><strong>What is This:</strong></h4>
                        
                        <p>
                            &emsp;This is a program built to find word permutations for a given input of letters based on a user selected length
                            of
                            resulting words. For example, the word permutations for the input “rea” with the output length set to 3 are “ear,
                            era, are”.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h4><strong>How it Works:</strong></h4>
                        <p>
                            &emsp;The program works by first finding the powerset for the given input. For example, the powerset for the input
                            “rea”
                            is &#123;{},{r}, {e}, {a}, {r,e}, {r,a}, {e,a}, {r,e,a}}. This powerset is then limited to the user selected output
                            size.
                            Continuing the example above, if the selected output size is 3 the powerset is reduced to &#123;{r,e,a}}. This
                            reduced
                            powerset is then passed to a permutation function.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            &emsp;The permutation function will find all permutations for each element of the reduced powerset passed to it. For
                            example, if it is passed the reduced powerset from above &#123;{r,e,a}} the resulting permutations are [[rea],
                            [rae],
                            [era], [ear], [are], [aer]]. This permutation array is then passed to a lookup function.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            &emsp;The lookup function will check each element of the permutations array against a lookup table populated with
                            real
                            words. The words in the lookup table are a collection of words from the <i>Official Scrabble Players Dictionary</i>
                            and
                            Wiktionary’s word frequency list. <i>(Credit to GitHub user dolph for making these sources open to use)</i> The
                            words that
                            are matched with an entry in this lookup table are then returned as an array. Continuing the example above the array
                            returned would be [[era], [ear], [are]].
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            &emsp;This program was built using a Javascript Node backend running Express.js for the server. It is exposing an
                            API endpoint that
                            is being consumed by a frontend built using Bootstrap3 for the responsive styling and Handlebars.js for the
                            templating. The application was deployed and hosted on Heroku.
